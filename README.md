# Pong_Game
This Pong game is made with the Turtle library in Python.

It is eactly similar to the first game ever made, the original pong!

This game is made with the turtle module.
Turtle is a simplified version of the more popular library Pygame, meaning that has slightly less features.
Turtle is a great starting place for beginners who would like to get into creating fun games in Python!
